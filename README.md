Mathematical Model (LaTeX)
--------------------------

Here is a simple mathematical expression that represents the total number of job applications (N) you have added:

$$N=∑i=1nAiN = \sum_{i=1}^{n} A_iN=i=1∑n​Ai​$$

Where $Ai$ is the application at position i, and nnn is the total number of applications.

Track your applications and stay organized!
